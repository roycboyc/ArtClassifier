# DeepStyleArtClassifier
## Specialization Project, Cornell Tech


Using Keras and Tensorflow to develop a classifier that can classify different art styles.
We will be leveraging weights from VGG16, VGG19, Inceptionv3, and ResNet50


## Installation

pip install -r requirements.txt
ipython notebook


### NOTE: I would recommend using virtualenv
